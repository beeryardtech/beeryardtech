## Services Offered

Our consulting staff has a combined 20+ years experience in the software
industry. The team stays on the leading edge of technologies, and follows
industry best practices throughout the development and support processes.

### Product Development, Setup, and Training

Our team specializes in building full-featured, high-quality software products.
Our goal is to exceed the customer's expectations for quality, customer
service, and delivering on time.  Once complete, our team works with the
customer to produce clear and precise documentation.

### User Interface Development and User Experience Design

More than ever, users are expecting the apps they interact with to be
intuitive, easy to use, and sometimes even fun. No longer is it acceptable to
require the user to read a massive manual just to do simple tasks. That is why
Beeryard Technology specializes in intuitive and simple to use designs. Our
goal is to make every customer's application a pleasant experience without the
burdens of bad design.


### Software Audits and Consultancy

Our team can provide extensive and through code auditing expertise to help any
project run smoother. We will provide instruction and coding to help build the
strength of any customer's team. This will allow all future projects to run
smoother and produce even better work.

Our experienced Software Architects can work with any team to develop a
architecture to meet the needs of the customer before any code is written. This
will help keep the project from suffering from the very time consuming and
expensive system rewrite.

### Team Coaching

The applications and services are developed by great teams. Those teams can be
achieved through effective coaching and mentorship. Beeryard Technology
provides services to help to build the best possible teams for any size company
or organization.
